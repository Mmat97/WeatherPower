- Display current data  and forecast data for the next week
- Can dynamically clikc and change days to get the data you want
- As a Start page, includes links to Gmail and Youtube 


## Process so Far..

- 1. Design the layout and UI of the application
- 2. Split the UI into individual components
- 3. Create search page
- 4. Create weather page 
- 5. Added Background image 
- 6. Added data to the weather page
- 7. Add api functionality using fetch 
- 8. Added erro notifications to handle input that doesn't work with OpenWeather API 
- 9. Created component unit tests 



## Basic Idea on how the app runs
1. Get input(root app and form component)
2. Error handling(form component and error component)
3. Go back to root app using form input to fetch from OpenWeather
4. Use data to fill in components conncted to root app.tsx file
